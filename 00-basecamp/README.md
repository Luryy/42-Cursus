## How to check this Repository

Each folder of this repository has the resolution of a list of exercises proposed by 42 tech team (unfortunately I can't share the PDF with those exercises because it's [42 France](https://www.42.fr/en/) intellectual property).
And inside each main folder has the resolution of each exercise of the specific list.

## Getting Started

#### Clone

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Luryy/42-Basecamp.git
```

And check each folder to see the implementation of basic concepts of C language.

#### Tip

The exercises are serials, the first ones are easiest and the level increases gradually.
